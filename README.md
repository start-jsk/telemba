Telemba builds your Roomba and Android into a new communication
tool. If you have a Roomba and an Android tablet (or phone), Telemba
is definitely easiest and cheapest way to build your own tele-presence
robot.

Telemba is open-source and open-hardware project. It is designed as
anyone can modify it adding sensors and RC servo motors to control as
the video shows.

Please see the wiki page of telemba for how to make your own telemba.
